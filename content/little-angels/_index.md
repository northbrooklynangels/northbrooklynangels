# Our History
North Brooklyn has transformed from a blue-collar community to a gentrified area with rising incomes. The median family income has risen to $107,630 in Greenpoint/Williamsburg and $74,890 in Bushwick. Despite this, economic insecurity remains high, with 56% of mothers in Greenpoint/Williamsburg and 72% in Bushwick relying on Medicaid. With an estimated $13,000 needed to raise a baby in their first year, the cost of parenting can become a significant burden for many underserved families.

In response to these challenges, North Brooklyn Angels launched the highly successful “Angel Babies” pop-up events to foster community support for mothers and families in need.

# Our Mission
As an initiative rooted within the North Brooklyn Angels’ vision of ‘neighbors helping neighbors’, Little Angels is focused on bridging the gap between North Brooklyn families with more resources and families in need during the early years of parenting. 

Our goal is to create a sustainable always-on ecosystem that unites families of diverse backgrounds and connects underserved families with donated nursing, infant, and toddler gear tailored to their specific needs.

# Our Program
Little Angels operates a private storefront in Williamsburg, where nursing, infant, and toddler gear donated by local families is stored. Using a digital inventory management system, Little Angels consults with North Brooklyn families in need to provide them with essential parenting items. Selected items are then personally delivered by our network of volunteers, fostering connection and community support.
