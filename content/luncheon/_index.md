Weâ€™re incredibly excited as we gear up for our upcoming signature luncheon event! Each year, we host our biggest fundraising event, a luncheon, honoring and celebrating local leaders who have supported North Brooklyn Angels. 

Check back here soon for more details on sponsorship levels, a new eJournal, ticket information, and our event brochure!
