# History & Mission of Greenpoint Community Yoga

Greenpoint Community Yoga was founded in February 2024 as a way to bring affordable and accessible yoga classes to the community while supporting North Brooklyn Angels.

We offer a monthly series of yoga classes, sound baths, and more. All classes are led by certified instructors and we welcome students at any experience level. Itâ€™s $10 to register and all proceeds go to North Brooklyn Angels. 

Plus, we get to practice in the beautiful space at [Ascension Church on Kent Street](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Church+of+the+Ascension/@40.7306809,-73.9554381,19z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x89c259408542c21f:0xcae725ecd05d3661!8m2!3d40.730966!4d-73.956036!16s%2Fg%2F1wn34l6t).
