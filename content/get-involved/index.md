Our goal is to be the place where newer & long term residents come together in support of feeding insecure neighbors in volunteer projects which aid members of our community struggling with economic change. Serving meals is only the beginningâ€¦

# Volunteer!

North Brooklyn Angels is **95% volunteer-powered**! Everything from driving our trucks, packaging hundreds of meals, to helping sort and distribute clothing to families in need, is done by our amazing volunteers. We rely on people every day to help us cook & clean in the kitchen and to serve meals from our fleet of mobile soup kitchen vehicles.

Below is our menu of ways to get involved as a volunteer! There's a strong likelihood that there's something for almost everyone!

* **Weekday lunch shifts:** Volunteer for a shift (or two!): sign up online through [Deed](http://bit.ly/nbadeed). Once you have signed up, look up North Brooklyn Angels to see the few upcoming shifts!
* **Small-but-crucial volunteer opportunities:** from time to time, we list our "extra mile" volunteer opportunities that require less time and are not posted to Deed. [Check them out via this Google Form!](https://bit.ly/nba2024survey)
