Our goal is to be the place where newer & long term residents come together in support of feeding insecure neighbors in volunteer projects which aid members of our community struggling with economic change. Serving meals is only the beginning…

# Volunteer!

North Brooklyn Angels is **95% volunteer-powered**! Everything from driving the truck to cooking the meals is done by amazing volunteers. We rely on people every day to help us cook & clean in the kitchen and to serve meals from the Angelmobile. 

Volunteer for a shift (or two!): sign up with [Deed](https://web.godeed.today/organization/5ba68de87e93fe6c785a6dcd) in order to sign up for shifts from your phone. Once you have signed up, look up North Brooklyn Angels to see the few upcoming shifts!
