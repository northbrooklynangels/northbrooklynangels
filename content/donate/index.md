It is no surprise as the cost of food and rents continue to soar higher each year that hunger persists in every corner of our neighborhood. The problem of food insecurity isn't just found in our homeless community; it is seniors struggling with fixed incomes & rising medical costs, children from working families that can't put a healthy meal on the table every night, the students who skip multiple meals in order to afford transportation to class, working families that find it hard to feed themselves at the end of the month, your neighbor across the hall or down the street living paycheck to paycheck, and larger pockets of poverty where whole communities in our neighborhood encounter hungry days. The meal gap can be anywhere from a couple meals a month to a daily struggle to eat.
