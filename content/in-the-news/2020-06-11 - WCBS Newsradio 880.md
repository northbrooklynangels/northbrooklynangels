**NEW YORK (WCB 880)** — Brooklyn kitchen workers are still working and people who need meals are still being fed thanks to an innovative program that was born during the coronavirus pandemic.

Jimmy’s Kitchen in Greenpoint is one of those popular neighborhood spots that had to close to the public because of the virus. But, that’s doesn’t mean the kitchen isn’t humming.

WCBS 880’s Mike Sugerman reports staff is still showing up every day to serve a new customer base with the help of the North Brooklyn Angels.

“They’re partnering with local kitchens in New York City and other places and are basically operating by paying them to be vendors, to produce food locally,” explains the Reverend John Merz, a founding member of the Brooklyn charity.

They normally serve meals out their bright blue truck seen around many North Brooklyn neighborhoods. 

But, when the pandemic started, they had to move their operation indoors. 

“Everything was heated, served, packed out and handed out on the truck. But since then because of health conditions it’s moved indoors,” says volunteer Paul Samulski.

Now, the North Brooklyn Angels have moved into a brand-new church facility to prepare meals for those who can’t afford to feed themselves – a group that continues to get larger as the pandemic persists. 

They also work with local restaurants to boost the number of meals they are able to produce each day.

“We don’t even have a vaccine. So nothing has really changed. And the economic fallout is getting worse,” said Merz.

They don’t know when thing will return to normal, but are prepared to continue to help.

Among the most appreciative diners are those at Woodhall Hospital, which receives 450 freshly cooked meals per day.
