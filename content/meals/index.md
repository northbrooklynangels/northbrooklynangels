North Brooklyn Angels aims to cook & serve 1,500 meals per week to combat the food insecure in our community. Each day, our Angelmobile fleet (so far, two vehicles!) currently serves, on average, 300 meals, depending on the site and the weather. Volunteers prep and serve all the food served in our community meals. 

Meals are available on a first come, first served basis and may all be distributed within 15-20 minutes (give or take) upon arrival, depending on the weather, holiday season, and other variables. Keep an eye out for either our white minivan or our hard-to-miss food trucks.
