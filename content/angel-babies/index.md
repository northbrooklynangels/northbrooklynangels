Showing the love to area families facing economic hardship is what the Angel Babies project does, several times a year! Building on the success of our Angel Babies events, North Brooklyn Angels is launching a year-round program connecting families in need with essential baby and toddler gear. We need your help to make this possible! Check out our presentation below and [sign up to learn more!](https://bit.ly/nba2024ab)

* **Donate**: As the need for resources continues to grow due to the pandemic and the refugee crisis, we’ve been grateful for the outpouring of in-kind donations that makes these Angel Babies giveaway events possible (and sustainable!). With our continued growth, and with supply chain and inflation impacting some of our resources (ie., diapers and school supplies), your donation dedicated to Angel Babies (now a permanent program) will keep these events going. Please donate below via PayPal (and select Angel Babies), or by Venmo ([@northbrooklynangels](https://venmo.com/northbrooklynangels)) and indicate Angel Babies in the memo.
