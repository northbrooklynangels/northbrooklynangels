Showing the love to area families facing economic hardship is what the Angel Babies project does, several times a year! 

Responding to community need and opportunities made possible by local partnerships and volunteer support, Angel Babies elevates our vision of "neighbors helping neighbors" as we mount big volunteer-driven giveaway events to local, new and expectant families who are in need of resources.  

Each time a campaign is ignited, for a few weeks, North Brooklyn businesses, schools, bars, cafes, and large apartment buildings sign on to host donation collections for this incredible giveaway event, netting thousands of Angel Babies donations! 

## Get Involved! Our next event is happening December 7th, 2023!

* **Volunteer**: North Brooklyn Angels relies on hundreds of phenomenal local volunteers and corporate volunteer groups to make these giveaways as efficient as they are impactful. Weeks before a giveaway event, volunteers help sort thousands of donated items, transport them to a designated event space, and staff the event. For an idea, check out [a recent Instagram post here](https://www.instagram.com/p/Crbnt8KPmnQ/?img_index=1). **Opt in** to receive bi-weekly emails on upcoming dates and opportunities by emailing volunteer@northbrooklynangels.org and follow us on Instagram!
* **Donate**: As the need for resources continues to grow due to the pandemic and the refugee crisis, we’ve been grateful for the outpouring of in-kind donations that makes these Angel Babies giveaway events possible (and sustainable!). With our continued growth, and with supply chain and inflation impacting some of our resources (ie., diapers and school supplies), your donation dedicated to the Angel Babies project (now a permanent program) will keep these events going. Please donate below via PayPal (and select Angel Babies), or by Venmo ([@northbrooklynangels](https://venmo.com/northbrooklynangels)) and indicate Angel Babies in the memo.
* **Drop off in-kind donations!** We’re accepting gently used and clean maternity, infant-children clothing, gear, toys, and books from local families. Visit our Google map of drop off points at [bit.ly/angelbabiesmap](https://bit.ly/angelbabiesmap).
