Every holiday season, North Brooklyn Angels hosts a multi-day event called Neighbors Giving Thanks. The goal is to bring a joyous and dignified Thanksgiving experience to our neighbors in Greenpoint/Williamsburg who may not have a place, or the means, to celebrate. 

**To make this happen, we need your help!** Your support means the world, as food (and turkey!) costs continue to rise. If you can donate, and then spread the word to others who might also contribute, that would go a long way to living the motto “neighbors helping neighbors”.

This project, orchestrated by many of our wonderful volunteers and community partners, is modeled off the past years’ successes. There is an ambitious number of phases, beginning a week before Thanksgiving:

* Distribution of ~1,000 frozen turkeys to families in need
* Preparation and distribution of over 1,000 delicious holiday meals at our regular community outposts Monday - Wednesday before Thanksgiving
* Coordinating **four** locations in North Brooklyn to serve over 500 sit-down Thanksgiving Day meals to our neighbors (with a pick-up option available for freshly packaged meals)
  * This will take place at Ascension Church in Greenpoint, Church of Our Lady of Mt. Carmel in Williamsburg, Most Holy Trinity Church in East Williamsburg and Bushwick Abbey Iglesia de la Santa Cruz in Bushwick

Your support in sponsoring this meaningful project will help us provide a memorable holiday experience for our many neighbors in need. Donate today via PayPal below and select “Neighbors Giving Thanks!”
