{{< carousel images="carousel1,carousel2,carousel3,carousel4,carousel5" aspectRatio="16:9" >}}

Since 2020, North Brooklyn Angels has hosted **Neighbors Giving Thanks**, a volunteer-driven, multi-day event that engages over 100 local volunteers to ensure our neighbors in Bushwick, Greenpoint, and Williamsburg experience a joyous and dignified Thanksgiving, regardless of means or circumstances.

We need your support to make this happen again in 2024! With rising food and turkey costs, your donation will go a long way. Please consider giving and spreading the word to others to keep our "neighbors helping neighbors" motto alive.

In November, we will:

* Distribute 1,000 frozen turkeys to local families in need.
* Prepare and distribute **over 1,000** holiday meals at our regular community locations from Monday to Wednesday before Thanksgiving.
* Transform four North Brooklyn locations into safe spaces to serve **almost 600 sit-down Thanksgiving meals** to our neighbors, with a pickup option for freshly packaged meals.

Your contribution will help us provide a warm, welcoming holiday to those who need it most. Donate online today via Paypal listed below, or by check addressed to 127 Kent Street, Brooklyn, NY. We also gladly accept donations via **Venmo** ([northbrooklynangels](https://venmo.com/northbrooklynangels)) and **Zelle** (fundraising@northbrooklynangels.org).
