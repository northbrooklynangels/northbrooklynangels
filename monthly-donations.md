# GIVE THE GIFT OF FOOD SECURITY

Hunger can affect people from all walks of life. Many New Yorkers are one job loss, one medical crisis, one rent raise away from food insecurity. Children & adults face hunger in our community every day. Your neighbor, childâ€™s classmate, or the person next to you on the train may be struggling to get enough to eat. 

To invest in a neighborhood without hunger, donate here* or mail a check payable to:

North Brooklyn Angels  
42 West Street #202  
Brooklyn, NY 11222

THANK YOU FOR MAKING A DIFFERENCE IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD!
