The Angels began their service in June 2017, powered with a 40 ft.</description></item><item><title>We Met Them in the Depths of the Pandemic.

The North Brooklyn Angels, in partnership with a bevy of other community groups, will bring 400 meals to those in need this Thanksgiving, the group announced last week. Organizers say the offerings will be a more elevated version of what the Angels usually offer, to allow for a “dignified Thanksgiving” during a challenging time.</description></item><item><title>North Brooklyn Angels Partner With Restaurants To Feed Those In Need</title><link>/in-the-news/2020/06/north-brooklyn-angels-partner-with-restaurants-to-feed-those-in-need/</link><pubDate>Thu, 11 Jun 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/in-the-news/2020/06/north-brooklyn-angels-partner-with-restaurants-to-feed-those-in-need/</guid><description>NEW YORK (WCB 880) — Brooklyn kitchen workers are still working and people who need meals are still being fed thanks to an innovative program that was born during the coronavirus pandemic.
Jimmy’s Kitchen in Greenpoint is one of those popular neighborhood spots that had to close to the public because of the virus. But, that’s doesn’t mean the kitchen isn’t humming.
WCBS 880’s Mike Sugerman reports staff is still showing up every day to serve a new customer base with the help of the North Brooklyn Angels.</description></item><item><title>North Brooklyn Angels Feed The Front Lines While Keeping Local Business Alive</title><link>/in-the-news/2020/04/north-brooklyn-angels-feed-the-front-lines-while-keeping-local-business-alive/</link><pubDate>Thu, 16 Apr 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/in-the-news/2020/04/north-brooklyn-angels-feed-the-front-lines-while-keeping-local-business-alive/</guid><description>A group of north Brooklyn do-gooders has ramped up their neighborly efforts during the coronavirus pandemic, becoming a lifeline not only to their neighbors in need but also to the staff of hard-hit Woodhull Hospital. While keeping up its regular acts of altruism, the North Brooklyn Angels have devised a system which provides the workers at Woodhull with three square meals a day from Jimmy&amp;rsquo;s Diner. This, in turn, keeps the beloved Greenpoint eatery &amp;mdash; which previously shut its doors due to the pandemic &amp;mdash; up and running.</description></item><item><title>North Brooklyn Mobile Soup Kitchen Adjusts to Pandemic, Grows Its Support</title><link>/in-the-news/2020/04/north-brooklyn-mobile-soup-kitchen-adjusts-to-pandemic-grows-its-support/</link><pubDate>Mon, 13 Apr 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/in-the-news/2020/04/north-brooklyn-mobile-soup-kitchen-adjusts-to-pandemic-grows-its-support/</guid><description>Volunteers formed a human assembly line in the basement of a Williamsburg church on a recent morning, donning N95 and surgical face masks and sanitized latex gloves as they filled to-go containers with meals.
It was a seemingly normal operation for the North Brooklyn Angels, a group that has been feeding Williamsburg and Greenpoint for about three years, but with the restrictions of the coronavirus binding them, the non-profit had to adjust to packing hundreds more meals, creating a network to feed local health care workers and making sure every step of the operation was safe for everyone involved.</description></item><item><title>How to Help in a Pandemic: Ask Before You Donate 1,000 Pizzas</title><link>/in-the-news/2020/04/how-to-help-in-a-pandemic-ask-before-you-donate-1000-pizzas/</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 Apr 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/in-the-news/2020/04/how-to-help-in-a-pandemic-ask-before-you-donate-1000-pizzas/</guid><description>A Brooklyn priest learned to cut through the red tape after Hurricane Sandy.

The &amp;ldquo;Angelmobile&amp;rdquo; is a sort of a &amp;ldquo;soup kitchen on wheels,&amp;rdquo; said Neil Sheen, co-founder of the nonprofit North Brooklyn Angels.
Originally, the North Brooklyn Angels served the Bedford-Stuyvesant community with a brick-and-mortar soup kitchen, St.</description></item><item><title>Neil Sheehan: Greenpoint native provides meals with wheels</title><link>/in-the-news/2018/02/neil-sheehan-greenpoint-native-provides-meals-with-wheels/</link><pubDate>Mon, 05 Feb 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/in-the-news/2018/02/neil-sheehan-greenpoint-native-provides-meals-with-wheels/</guid><description>The idea that some people go to bed without a hot meal just didn&amp;rsquo;t sit right with Neil Sheehan.
&amp;ldquo;People need to eat. And helping someone eat, whether it&amp;rsquo;s with your family sitting down or with your friends or with your neighbors, it&amp;rsquo;s a gesture where people smile, they&amp;rsquo;re nourished and it creates good will,&amp;rdquo; Sheehan said.
Nourishing people&amp;rsquo;s bodies while also nourishing his native Greenpoint has always been Sheehan&amp;rsquo;s top priority.</description></item><item><title>Donate</title><link>/donate/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/donate/</guid><description>New!
