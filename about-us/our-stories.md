title: Our Stories
---

Our goal is for North Brooklyn Angels to be the gathering point where newer residents join with longtime residents, utilizing their creativity, sense of social justice, passion, and skills to aid those in need in our North Brooklyn community. While we will initially start with serving meals, addressing in a small way the hunger gap that exists in North Brooklyn, we hope to tackle large & small needs that exist on our streets. In the process of feeding people and developing service projects, we hope to demonstrate that the most effective sustainable change occurs when neighbors help neighbors. These are our stories; stories about our community, our neighbors, our volunteers.

# The OG Idea

"We were discussing the pressures of gentrification and reality of the closing of our soup kitchen, brainstorming ideas and reviewing the problems we had encountered over the years of feeding people and during Hurricane Sandy. The closing created a new opportunity for us to address our current model of serving meals from a set location on highly residential streets in Greenpoint. We became inspired to use the opportunity to create something more viable -- a mobile infrastructure that could meet the need where it exists, remove the burden of transportation and travel from the diners, and increase our servings from 100 to 4,000 per week."
