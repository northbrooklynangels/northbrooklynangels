# Neighbors Helping Neighbors
Hey there Brooklyn! We are the North Brooklyn Angels, a volunteer-powered, hyper-local, grassroots non-profit that organizes direct action projects to address the many needs that exist in our own backyard: hunger, poverty, homelessness & housing instability.

## LEARN MORE ABOUT THE NEED IN OUR COMMUNITY

We run a mobile soup kitchen, called the Angelmobile, which serves hot lunch 6 days a week at various locations around the neighborhood. We cook all the food for our meals in our community kitchen located in the Mt Carmel Parish Hall. Volunteers prep & cook all the food we serve. Volunteers set up & serve all of our lunches. Volunteers do almost everything from dishes to design. Sometimes, they even drive the truck! We are always looking for ways neighbors can band together to help & support a neighbor in need.
