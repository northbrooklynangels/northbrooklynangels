**Our goal** is to be the place where newer & longterm residents come together in support of feeding insecure neighbors in volunteer projects which aid members of our community struggling with economic change. Serving meals is only the beginning...

**North Brooklyn Angels is 95% volunteer-powered!** Everything from driving the truck to cooking the meals is done by amazing volunteers. We rely on people every day to help us cook & clean in the kitchen and to serve meals from the Angelmobile. In addition, we need help with admin tasks, fundraising, and outreach for volunteers and to promote the meals. 

**In order to be accessible to all our neighbors,** we try to utilize all the ways to get people involved in our programs and signed up for volunteer shifts. We use our website, email, apps, social media messaging, text, phone, and in-person methods to get people linked into our program. 

**IF YOU WANT TO VOLUNTEER THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS TO GET ON THE DEED APP!** We use an app to schedule some shifts -- sign up with [**Deed**](http://godeed.today/) in order to sign up for shifts from your phone. Once you have signed up, look up North Brooklyn Angels to see the few upcoming shifts!
